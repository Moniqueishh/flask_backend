# API's we need

#DO we want to be able to search or add dates?
#If so, thats how we would search historical data for the weather API
#If not, lets do that last at least 

#Weather API (get from HW)
#possibly need to pull historic dates to forcast the weather for specific dates (Statistical Weather Data API)


#Spotify playlist for the place searched(Rewatch flask API class)

#Youtube videos based off place searched (can probably youtube how to do this)

#Possible Pinterest API or an API that can pick suggested outfits for the searched place?

# EXTRA:
# TRY to find an API that will let you see travel, or potentially book travel
